`This question brings so many thoughts, memories, and even emotions that I need to go back in times and start from there. I was taking Coding classes in high school and I still remember my first simple game written in QBasic, endless coding classes in C++ or Delphi. It was not fun at all! No! I did not find it difficult, but at the same time, I did not want to spend my life sitting in front of the computer.`


`There is a question about challenges almost in every interview. At that time, I was afraid to face them. Coding is boring - move on! Technical mind, but hate physics - choose the least technical profession. This was why I decided to get a degree in Geology. Those people get field trips and work a lot outdoors. Who knew! Faith played its own game and I ended up graduating with Geophysics degree. Yeah, my favorite physics! Moreover, I have an office job and spend 70+ hours sitting in front of the screens. Lame, I know!`


`Working in technical services and I spend all my time operating with different pieces of software. Challenges have become my daily routine and I feel anxious without them. High Tech became obligatory and is not optional anymore. We communicate with technologies every day. To understand them or even talk to them we have to learn its Alphabet - Coding. This is why I am here! To face my new-old challenge and to learn how to communicate with the XXI century!`
